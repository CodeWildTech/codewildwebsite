## 📝 Commit Guidelines

We follow conventional commit messages for clarity:

- `feat:` - A new feature
- `fix:` - A bug fix
- `docs:` - Documentation changes
- `style:` - Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor:` - Code refactoring without changing functionality
- `test:` - Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` - Maintenance tasks

**Example:**

```bash
git commit -m "feat: add dark mode toggle to navbar"
git commit -m "fix: resolve mobile menu overflow issue"
```

## 🎨 Code Style

- Use **functional components** with hooks
- Follow **React best practices**
- Use **Tailwind CSS** for styling (avoid inline styles)
- Keep components **small and focused**
- Add **comments** for complex logic
- Use **meaningful variable names**

## 📦 Pull Request Process

1. **Update documentation** if needed (README, comments, etc.)
2. **Ensure all tests pass** and the build succeeds
3. **Push your branch** to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name

4. **Open a Pull Request** on GitHub
5. **Describe your changes** clearly in the PR description
6. **Link any related issues** using keywords like "Fixes #123"
